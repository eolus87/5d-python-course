# 5d-python-course
Python course. It is meant to be developed in 5 days, with 2 hours a day. 
It is divided in theory, workshops and a hackathon. The practical sessions 
are developed using scripts, mainly with Spyder and PyCharm IDEs.

## Prerequisites
This course main goal is being an introduction to Python. Some previous knowledge 
of any other programming language is recommended, but not required.

## Content
The course is meant to give an introductory overview of Python. It consists of 5 sessions:

1) __Python/Programming Theory__: It is based on pdf slides. It starts with the presentation
of myself, the students and the course. Then it answers the questions What, Why and How
about Python programming. Finally, there is some configuration steps for Python in 
Windows and a script to check everything as gone well.
2) __Python basics__: This is the first workshop. 
It covers:
   - Description of Spyder IDE
   - Basic Python types
   - Indexing
   - Logic evaluation
   - Iterations
   - Functions
   - Exceptions
3) __Third party packages__: Some exercises regarding commong 3rd party libraries:
   - Interpolation
   - Numerical derivation
   - Numerical integration
   - Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
   - Minimization
   - FFT
   - Plotting with matplotlib
   - Getting data and filtering with Pandas
   
   NOTE: The dataset for this exercise is coming from Kaggle. The exercises here
are very tailored for mechanical engineers.
4) __Python Advanced__: This folder has some slides to explain the programming paradigms, mainly
to give some context before jumping into Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
    - List comprehensions
    - Context managers
    - Type hinting
    - Logging
    - Decorators
    - OOP and Classes
    - Introduction to PyCharm IDE
5) __Hackathon__: A competitive session to close the course.
   - The students are divided into groups of around 5.
   - The challenge will be based on: 
     - Reading and understanding online documentation.
     - Getting certain kind of data.
     - Slightly processing the data (mainly filtering).
     - Plotting data.
   - Different number of points are assigned to the groups depending on the results
   of every step, the winner is the team with the highest amount of points.

## Recommended usage
Clone the repo or download it to your machine. Then it is just following the instructions 
included in the comments. The code is divided in cells (they can be seen directly with 
Spyder or VSCode, but it requires a special plugin in PyCharm).
